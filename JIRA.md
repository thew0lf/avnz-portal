# üìÑ JIRA.md ‚Äì Avnz App Team Setup

## üéØ Objective
Configure the **Avnz App** project in Jira with full Product, Development, QA, and DevOps teams.  
Create users with `@avnz.io` emails, add them to a team group, assign project roles, configure workflow, and link Jira with Confluence.  

---

## üë• Team Roster with Emails

Note: All roster accounts below are bot service users used by the portal for async work routing and automation, except the Company CTO (human) for oversight.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
JIRA_EMAIL=bill@tandgconsulting.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
JIRA_DOMAIN=tandgconsulting.atlassian.net
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Jira Configuration Steps

### 1. Create Jira Group
Group name: `avnz-app-team`

```bash
curl -s -X POST   -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" | base64)"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   "https://$JIRA_DOMAIN/rest/api/3/group"   -d '{"name":"avnz-app-team"}'
```

---

### 2. Add Users to Group
Create users with the above emails. Then, add them to `avnz-app-team`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST   -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" | base64)"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   "https://$JIRA_DOMAIN/rest/api/3/group/user?groupname=avnz-app-team"   -d '{"accountId":"<ACCOUNT_ID>"}'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Repeat for each user after retrieving their `accountId`.

---

### 3. Get Project Role IDs

```bash
curl -s -X GET   -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" | base64)"   "https://$JIRA_DOMAIN/rest/api/3/project/AVNZ/role" | jq .
```

---

### 4. Assign Roles

- **Administrators** ‚Üí Emma Johansson (PM), Raj Patel (Scrum Master)  
- **Developers** ‚Üí Lucas Meyer, Carlos Hern√°ndez, Sophia Li, David O‚ÄôConnor, Aisha Khan, Mateo Rossi, Hannah Wright, Nguyen Minh, Olivia Brown  
- **QA** ‚Üí Fatima El-Sayed, Daniel Kim, Laura Silva, Michael Carter, Anastasia Petrov  

Example (replace `<ROLE_ID>` and `<acct_*>`):

```bash
curl -s -X POST   -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" | base64)"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   "https://$JIRA_DOMAIN/rest/api/3/project/AVNZ/role/<ROLE_ID>"   -d '{"user":["<acct_Emma>","<acct_Raj>"]}'
```

---

### 5. Configure Workflow (Team‚Äëmanaged, current Jira UI)

AVNZ is a Team‚Äëmanaged (next‚Äëgen) project. In Team‚Äëmanaged projects you manage statuses primarily through the Board Columns UI, not the global workflow editor.

- Recommended statuses (final state):  
  `To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Review ‚Üí QA Testing ‚Üí Blocked ‚Üí Done`

- Add/move statuses via Board Columns
  - Open your board, then More (¬∑¬∑¬∑) ‚Üí Board settings ‚Üí Columns.  
    Direct link for AVNZ board: `/jira/software/c/projects/AVNZ/boards/57/settings/columns`  
  - Add columns (if missing): ‚ÄúIn Review‚Äù, ‚ÄúQA Testing‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlocked‚Äù.
  - Map statuses:  
    - In Review: 1st review, Sr Dev Review  
    - QA Testing: QA  
    - In Progress: In Progress  
    - Blocked: Blocked (create this status if it doesn‚Äôt exist; it will inherit the In Progress category)

- Alternative workflow view in Team‚Äëmanaged  
  Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Issue types ‚Üí pick an issue type ‚Üí Workflow ‚Üí Edit. Add the ‚ÄúBlocked‚Äù status there if preferred, then it can be mapped under Board settings ‚Üí Columns.

- Automation (optional)  
  - When an issue transitions to In Review, auto-create a QA sub‚Äëtask.  
  - Prevent transition to Done unless QA sub‚Äëtask is Done.  
  - Set defaults: Epics/Stories ‚Üí Product Manager; Bugs ‚Üí QA Manager.

---

### 6. Confluence Integration

- Create **Confluence Space: Avnz App**.  
- Create a page: **Avnz App Team Roster & Responsibilities**.  
- Link Epics/Stories to Confluence docs for requirements and retrospectives.  
- Scrum Master ensures Confluence pages stay updated (meeting notes, retros, velocity).  

---

---

## üîÅ Automation Flow (Portal Integration)

Goal: Issues flow through development automatically ‚Äî when Jira moves an issue to In Progress, the portal queues work; when the portal completes, Jira is updated and advanced (e.g., to In Review), and QA steps can be auto-queued.

### Webhook ‚Üí Portal (required)
- Endpoint (ngrok/public): `POST {NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/jira/events/{orgCode}`
- Header: `X-Jira-Secret: <shared_secret>`
- Body (JSON): include event, changelog, and issue details. Example (Automation ‚Üí Send web request ‚Üí Custom data):

```json
{
  "event": "jira:issue_updated",
  "changelog": { "items": [ { "field": "status", "toString": "In Progress" } ] },
  "issue": {
    "id": "{{issue.id}}",
    "key": "{{issue.key}}",
    "fields": {
      "summary": "{{issue.summary}}",
      "description": "{{issue.description}}",
      "status": { "name": "In Progress" }
    }
  },
  "user": { "displayName": "{{initiator.displayName}}" }
}
```

The portal verifies the secret per org. Store the secret in Admin ‚Üí Secrets (`service=jira`, `name=webhook_secret`), or use `JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for local.

### Direct Queue (belt-and-suspenders)
Add a second Automation action to queue a portal job directly. This ensures a job is created even if a webhook is delayed, and the portal still deduplicates via `jira_jobs`.

- Endpoint: `POST {NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/api/agents/jobs`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body:

```json
{ "task": "[Jira {{issue.key}}] {{issue.summary}}\n\n{{issue.description}}", "meta": { "jira_issue_key": "{{issue.key}}" } }
```

### Portal ‚Üí Jira (on completion)
When a portal job completes, the portal posts a comment to the issue with a brief usage summary and the plan/implementation/review snippets, and optionally transitions the issue to the next status (default: In Review).

Environment (portal API):
- `SERVICE_TOKEN` ‚Äî required for internal callbacks
- `JIRA_TRANSITION_ON_COMPLETE=In Review` ‚Äî optional target status

### Backfill + Polling (catch-up safety)
To ensure no work is missed:
- On API startup: backfill queries Jira for all `In Progress` issues and queues any missing jobs.
- Polling (optional): set `JIRA_BACKFILL_INTERVAL_SEC` (e.g., `300`) to repeat the backfill periodically.

Environment (portal API):
- `JIRA_BACKFILL_ON_START=1`
- `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=AVNZ`
- `JIRA_DEFAULT_ORG_CODE=<your_org_code>`
  - `JIRA_BACKFILL_INTERVAL_SEC=300` (optional)

### Phase Gate: Work‚ÄëBefore‚ÄëTransition (Required)
- Do not advance issues to the next phase until the corresponding portal job has completed successfully.
- Jira Automation must not auto‚Äëtransition on its own; it may only queue work (webhook/direct‚Äëqueue) or trigger validation tasks (QA/Test/Audit).
- The portal (agents‚Äëcomplete) is the authoritative gate that moves an issue forward after work is finished (and comments the results for auditability).
- To hold an issue in its current phase for manual review, apply the lock label (default `assignee-locked`) or populate the phase‚Äëowner field; the portal will not override the assignee or state.

### Ticket Content Standard (Required)
- Every ticket must include a high-quality description that covers:
  - Context: 2‚Äì3 sentence problem statement
  - User Story: As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>
  - Acceptance Criteria: check-list form
  - Definition of Done
  - Implementation Guide: code pointers, endpoints, migrations, flags
  - Testing & QA Details: unit/integration coverage and manual steps
  - Risk & Rollback
- The portal can auto-enrich new tickets (issue_created) with this structure, but the PM/Owner remains responsible for verifying/editing the details.

### Specificity & Accuracy (Required)
- Descriptions must be tailored to the specific ticket. Do not use generic boilerplate or speculative/fabricated information.
- If exact details are unknown, mark items as `TBD` with an explicit owner and due date, rather than inventing content.
- Automation may propose initial structure, but PM/Owner must verify factual accuracy and replace placeholders before a ticket is allowed to advance.
- The portal blocks transitions when placeholder markers are detected (e.g., `As a <role>`, `Criteria 1`, generic ‚ÄúProvide a 2‚Äì3 sentence problem statement‚Äù). The ticket will be labeled `needs-details` with a comment prompting completion.

### Priority Policy (Required)
- Every ticket must have a meaningful Priority; do not leave as ‚ÄúLowest‚Äù or empty.
- Default policy: assign Medium unless the PM/Owner sets a higher/lower priority based on impact and urgency.
- Automation: The portal may default Priority to Medium on newly created issues if missing/Lowest (configurable per org via `default_priority`).
- Bulk update helper:
  - Use `scripts/jira-set-default-priority.sh 'project = AVNZ AND (priority is EMPTY OR priority = Lowest)' Medium` to normalize legacy backlogs.
### Status Map (recommended)
- To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Review ‚Üí QA Testing ‚Üí Done
- Automation examples:
  - When ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí send webhook + direct queue
  - When ‚Üí In Review ‚Üí optionally queue a QA job: send to `/api/agents/jobs` with task "[QA {{issue.key}}] Validate acceptance criteria‚Ä¶"
  - When ‚Üí Done ‚Üí optionally queue an audit job to summarize changes/tests

### Operations
- Secrets: Set Jira webhook secret per org in the portal at `/admin/secrets`.
- ngrok: Start and set `NGROK_PUBLIC_URL` so admins see the full Request URL on the Slack/Jira dashboard pages.

### Role-based Assignment (Configurable)
- The portal assigns issues automatically to phase owners without hardcoding names.
- Configure per-org assignees in Admin ‚Üí Secrets (`service=jira`). Values can be a single name/email or a comma/semicolon‚Äëseparated list to enable distribution:
  - `assignee_dev`, `assignee_review`, `assignee_qa`, `assignee_test`, `assignee_audit`
  - Example: `assignee_dev = "Lucas Meyer|Senior Developer, Carlos Hern√°ndez|Developer; Sophia Li|Developer"` (display includes titles; assignment uses the name/email portion)
- Distribution policy:
  - Least-loaded selection (default): choose the user with the fewest open issues in the project (statusCategory != Done). Ties fall back to round‚Äërobin (Redis key `rr:jira:assignee:{orgId}:{phase}`), else random if Redis unavailable.
  - Set `JIRA_LOAD_BALANCE=0` to disable load-based selection and use RR/random only.
- "Unless selected" rule:
  - If a phase owner field is populated on the issue (e.g., Reviewer/QA/Test/Audit custom fields), that user is assigned.
  - If a lock label is present (`JIRA_ASSIGNMENT_LOCK_LABEL`, default `assignee-locked`) or an assignee is already present on the issue, the portal will not override the assignee.
- Optional env fallback (local/dev):
  - `JIRA_ASSIGNEE_DEV`, `JIRA_ASSIGNEE_REVIEW`, `JIRA_ASSIGNEE_QA`, `JIRA_ASSIGNEE_TEST`, `JIRA_ASSIGNEE_AUDIT` (single value) or
  - `JIRA_ASSIGNEE_DEV_LIST` (CSV), etc., for multi‚Äëuser distributions.
- Field overrides (preferred when available): set Jira custom field ids to override per-phase assignment:
  - `JIRA_REVIEWER_FIELD_ID`, `JIRA_QA_FIELD_ID`, `JIRA_TEST_FIELD_ID`, `JIRA_AUDIT_FIELD_ID`
  - When a field is populated for a phase, the user in that field is assigned regardless of lists.

### Issue Enrichment (Auto-brief)
- New issues can be auto-enriched by the portal on `issue_created` webhooks:
  - The portal updates the issue description (or comments) with a structured brief containing:
    - Context, Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Done, Implementation Guide, Testing & QA Checklist, Risk & Rollback, Owner Notes (for Human Execution).
  - Label `auto-briefed` is added when possible.
- Backfill enrichment for existing issues:
  - Run: `scripts/jira-enrich-all.sh 'project = AVNZ AND statusCategory != Done'`
  - Requires `SERVICE_TOKEN` in `.env` and Jira credentials.

## ü§ñ Jira Automation Rules (Templates)

## üß∞ Preparation Scripts

Before proceeding with automated processing, normalize the backlog so every ticket is actionable:

- Validate description, add auto-brief, set default priority:
  - `scripts/jira-prep-backlog.sh 'project = AVNZ AND statusCategory != Done' Medium --backfill`
  - Runs `jira-validate-and-enrich.sh` (adds ADF auto-brief comment and needs-details label when required sections are missing) and `jira-set-default-priority.sh` (sets Priority when missing/Lowest). With `--backfill`, queues In Progress issues.

- Manual commands (advanced):
  - `scripts/jira-validate-and-enrich.sh '<JQL>'`
  - `scripts/jira-set-default-priority.sh '<JQL>' Medium` (use `--force` to override existing priorities)
  - `scripts/jira-backfill-and-status.sh` (trigger backfill + print AI jobs)

Below are ready-to-paste recipes for Jira Cloud Automation (Project settings ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Create rule). These use the portal endpoints documented above. Replace `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}` and `{orgCode}`.

### Rule A ‚Äî In Progress ‚Üí Queue portal work (webhook + direct queue)
- Trigger: Issue transitioned
  - From: Any status; To: In Progress
- Action 1: Send web request (POST)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/jira/events/{orgCode}`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`, `X-Jira-Secret: <your-secret>`
  - Web request body (Custom data):
```json
{
  "event": "jira:issue_updated",
  "changelog": { "items": [ { "field": "status", "toString": "In Progress" } ] },
  "issue": {
    "id": "{{issue.id}}",
    "key": "{{issue.key}}",
    "fields": {
      "summary": "{{issue.summary}}",
      "description": "{{issue.description}}",
      "status": { "name": "In Progress" }
    }
  },
  "user": { "displayName": "{{initiator.displayName}}" }
}
```
- Action 2: Send web request (POST) ‚Äî direct queue (belt-and-suspenders)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/api/agents/jobs`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Body:
```json
{ "task": "[Jira {{issue.key}}] {{issue.summary}}\n\n{{issue.description}}", "meta": { "jira_issue_key": "{{issue.key}}" } }
```

### Rule B ‚Äî In Review ‚Üí Queue QA validation
- Trigger: Issue transitioned ‚Üí In Review
- Action: Send web request (POST)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/api/agents/jobs`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Body:
```json
{ "task": "[QA {{issue.key}}] Validate acceptance criteria, generate or verify unit tests, propose edge cases.\n\nSummary: {{issue.summary}}\n\nDescription: {{issue.description}}", "meta": { "jira_issue_key": "{{issue.key}}", "phase": "qa" } }
```

### Rule C ‚Äî QA Testing ‚Üí Queue test execution (optional)
- Trigger: Issue transitioned ‚Üí QA Testing
- Action: Send web request (POST)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/api/agents/jobs`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Body:
```json
{ "task": "[TEST {{issue.key}}] Execute/verify tests, summarize failures, propose fixes.\n\nSummary: {{issue.summary}}", "meta": { "jira_issue_key": "{{issue.key}}", "phase": "test" } }
```

### Rule D ‚Äî Done ‚Üí Queue audit summary (optional)
- Trigger: Issue transitioned ‚Üí Done
- Action: Send web request (POST)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/api/agents/jobs`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Body:
```json
{ "task": "[AUDIT {{issue.key}}] Summarize implementation notes, risks, and test coverage; generate release notes.", "meta": { "jira_issue_key": "{{issue.key}}", "phase": "audit" } }
```

### Rule E ‚Äî Comment contains "retest" ‚Üí Queue re‚Äëtest (optional)
- Trigger: Issue commented
- Condition: `{{comment.body}}` contains `retest`
- Action: Send web request (POST)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/api/agents/jobs`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
  - Body:
```json
{ "task": "[RETEST {{issue.key}}] Re-run QA validation after changes. Note: {{comment.body}}", "meta": { "jira_issue_key": "{{issue.key}}", "phase": "qa-retest" } }
```

### Rule F ‚Äî Scheduled catch-up (safety net)
- Trigger: Scheduled
  - JQL: `project = AVNZ AND status = "In Progress"`
- Action: Send web request (POST)
  - URL: `{NGROK_PUBLIC_URL}/jira/events/{orgCode}`
  - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`, `X-Jira-Secret: <your-secret>`
  - Body:
```json
{ "event": "jira:scheduled-backfill", "issuesJql": "project = AVNZ AND status = \"In Progress\"" }
```
Notes: The portal also runs its own startup/polling backfill; this scheduled rule adds an additional safety net in Jira.

## Quality Gate: No Placeholder Content (Required)
The portal must never insert generic placeholders into Jira issues. Enforcement:
- Prompts strictly forbid templates like `As a <role>`, `<capability>`, `<benefit>`, or `Criteria 1/2/3`.
- On AI completion, the API scans generated text for banned patterns. If detected, it skips description updates, applies the `needs-details` label, and posts a reminder comment.
- Transitions are blocked until concrete, ticket‚Äëspecific details are present.

## Epic Standards (Required)
Every EPIC must include the following sections in Description (ADF):
- Epic Goal ‚Äî The outcome and why it matters.
- Scope ‚Äî What is covered; Out of Scope ‚Äî What is explicitly excluded.
- Deliverables ‚Äî Concrete artifacts (endpoints, pages, scripts, docs, infra).
- Milestones ‚Äî Key checkpoints/timeboxes.
- Success Metrics ‚Äî Objective measures to declare the EPIC successful.
- Stakeholders & Dependencies ‚Äî Owners, consumers, and blocking systems.
- Risks & Assumptions ‚Äî Known risks, mitigation, and assumptions.
- Definition of Done ‚Äî Conditions required to close the EPIC.

Automation/Enforcement:
- On job completion, if issuetype is Epic and required sections are missing, the portal adds `needs-epic-details`, comments the missing requirements, and skips transitions.
- Docgen prompts switch to EPIC mode when issuetype is Epic to generate these sections (no placeholders).

## Roles & Responsibilities

The project operates with clear role ownership to speed delivery and improve quality. Use these definitions when assigning issues and reviewing work.

- Product Owner (Emma Johansson)
  - Owns roadmap, Epics, and backlog prioritization; writes Epic Goal and Acceptance Criteria; approves scope and final acceptance; stakeholder comms.
- Tech Lead / Architect
  - Sets technical direction and patterns (RBAC, soft‚Äëdeletes, migrations, UI standards, security); reviews architecture and risky changes; signs off on migrations and API/RPS contracts.
- Web Engineer (Next.js App Router)
  - Implements admin/dashboard pages using shadcn; builds SPA forms + toasts; maintains `/api/*` web proxy routes; ensures mobile‚Äëfriendly, a11y, and consistent layouts; adds tests where applicable.
- API Engineer (NestJS)
  - Designs and implements controllers/endpoints with RBAC guards; authors idempotent SQL migrations under `db/init`; integrates secrets via Service Configs; implements webhooks and pricing/usage logic; hardens security.
- AI Engineer (FastAPI)
  - Implements AI service routers (e.g., RPS), docgen/orchestration logic, workers, PII redaction, embeddings/vector search; reports usage; ensures auth propagation (org/user) via tokens.
- QA Engineer
  - Creates test plans aligned to AC; runs health/smoke/walkthrough; writes/executes unit/integration tests; validates mobile/UI consistency; tracks defects and retests fixes.
- DevOps / SRE
  - Owns dev/CI/CD/infra: Docker Compose, ngrok, Terraform/K8s/Helm/Argo/KEDA/SQS, External Secrets/DNS; configures monitoring/logging; manages secrets; keeps environments healthy.
- Security & Compliance
  - Enforces SOC2 patterns: secrets in DB/SSM, audit log, non‚Äëenumerating auth, CSP; reviews data flows/PII; conducts access reviews and security gates.
- Designer / UX
  - Ensures design consistency; validates shadcn usage, spacing/typography, responsive/mobile patterns; contributes to interaction design and a11y.
- Project Manager / Scrum Master
  - Runs ceremonies, unblocks teams, maintains board hygiene and metrics, coordinates cross‚Äëteam dependencies; communicates status/risks.
- Data / Analytics (optional)
  - Defines success metrics and dashboards; validates usage/pricing data; supports experiment and reporting needs.

Phase ownership and handoffs
- Dev ‚Üí Review ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Audit phases map to Jira transitions and worker phases.
  - Dev: implementation, unit tests, docs (SUMMARY.MD), usage instrumentation.
  - Review: code review (security/perf/RBAC/migrations/UI), actionable feedback.
  - QA: acceptance tests against AC; mobile/a11y/regression checks.
  - Test: broader execution or pre‚Äërelease validation; report defects.
  - Audit: release notes, risk/rollback, observability/alerts, final sign‚Äëoff.

Assignment defaults
- Configure per‚Äëphase assignees under Admin ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí service `jira` keys:
  - `assignee_dev`, `assignee_review`, `assignee_qa`, `assignee_test`, `assignee_audit`
  - Optional: `load_balance` (1 = least‚Äëloaded), `assignment_lock_label` (default `assignee-locked`).
- The portal auto‚Äëassigns on queue if no assignee is set (respects lock label if present).

### Quick Assignment Guide (Who to Assign)
- RPS Admin UI page (Next.js/shadcn) ‚Üí Web Engineer; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead
- Web API proxy route (/api/...) ‚Üí Web Engineer; Reviewer ‚Üí API Engineer
- NestJS endpoint/controller + migration ‚Üí API Engineer; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead
- AI FastAPI router/docgen/job orchestration ‚Üí AI Engineer; Reviewer ‚Üí API Engineer
- Pricing/Usage/Costs wiring ‚Üí API Engineer; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead
- Doc updates (SUMMARY.MD, READMEs) ‚Üí Product Owner or Engineer closest to change; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead
- CI/infra (Docker/Compose/Helm/Terraform/KEDA/SQS/Secrets) ‚Üí DevOps/SRE; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead
- Security/compliance changes (secrets, auth, PII, CSP) ‚Üí Security & Compliance; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead
- Design polish/UX copy/accessibility ‚Üí Designer/UX; Reviewer ‚Üí Product Owner
- Test plans/automation/smoke/walkthrough ‚Üí QA Engineer; Reviewer ‚Üí Tech Lead

Assignment guardrails (Required)
- The Company CTO (Bill Cuevas) must never be auto‚Äëassigned to Jira issues. Portal assignment logic excludes CTO by default and honors an exclusion list.
- Configure additional excludes via Admin ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí service `jira` ‚Üí key `assignment_exclude` (CSV/semicolon/newline), or env `JIRA_ASSIGNMENT_EXCLUDE`.
- In Jira project settings, set Default assignee to ‚ÄúUnassigned‚Äù (or a routing bot), not the CTO.

### Keeping Bots Working (Stale Ticket Strategy)
- Webhooks: Primary trigger on status change (e.g., In Progress). Ensure 2xx and monitor API logs; retries handled by Jira Automation.
- Backfill: Portal polls every 5 minutes to queue any In Progress tickets missed by webhooks.
- Stale requeue (script): Use `scripts/jira-requeue-stale.sh [minutes]` to queue bot work for tickets not updated within a window (maps status‚Üíphase).
  - Default mapping: In Progress‚Üídev, In Review‚Üíreview, QA Testing‚Üíqa; Blocked‚Üídev.
  - Example: `bash scripts/jira-requeue-stale.sh 30`.
- Jira Automation (optional safety net): Scheduled rule with JQL `statusCategory != Done AND updated <= -30m` ‚Üí POST to `/jira/events/:orgCode` or `/api/agents/jobs` to re‚Äëtrigger.

### Branching & Merge Policy (Required)
- Branches:
  - Controlled by env `GIT_WORK_BRANCH` (default `design-2`).
  - Epic branch: `<GIT_WORK_BRANCH>/<EPIC_KEY>` (e.g., `design-2/AVNZ-10`).
  - Child ticket branch: `<GIT_WORK_BRANCH>/<EPIC_KEY>/<TICKET_KEY>` (e.g., `design-2/AVNZ-10/AVNZ-12`).
- Bot behavior:
  - Bots write code to the local repo; when enabled, they commit on the ticket branch and open a PR.
  - QA bots validate (health/smoke/tests) and post results to Jira. Require passing checks/labels before merge.
- Merge order:
  - Merge child ticket branches into the epic branch after QA approval and docs.
  - When all children complete under an epic, merge the epic branch into `design2`.
- Configure env for auto‚Äëcommit/PR on aiworker: `AUTO_COMMIT=1`, `GIT_REMOTE_URL`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GIT_MAIN_BRANCH`.
